     如果启动就去检测 建议延时调用
     eg:[self performSelector:@selector(login:) withObject:nil afterDelay:0.35f];
     
     由于检测网络有一定的延迟，所以如果启动app立即去检测调用[AFNetworkReachabilityManager sharedManager].networkReachabilityStatus 有可能得到的是status == AFNetworkReachabilityStatusUnknown;但是此时明明是有网的，建议在收到监听网络状态回调以后再取[AFNetworkReachabilityManager sharedManager].networkReachabilityStatus。
